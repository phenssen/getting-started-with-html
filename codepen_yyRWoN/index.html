<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The main type of document on the web is HTML.
  <br>
  The web consits out of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page, the computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
<br><br>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". <br><br>
  The HTML markup consist of an opening tag and a closing tag while the whole thing is called an element. In general there is:
  <br>
 --  "b" in order to bold something <br>
 -- "em" in order to italicize something<br><br>

Generally an HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.
<br><br>
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
<br>
Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. 
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. In general tags can have multipe attributes.

 Anchors are for making links. The tags use the href attribute which includes the actual link. 
  <br>
  There is also an image tag which uses the "src" attribute. Important here is that the image tag is a so called "void tag". It doesn't have any content and therefore doesn't have a closing tag. An image is included by: "img src="url" alt="text". The text gets discplyed when the images is not there. 

</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.

  Text is displayed on multiple lines. <br><br>In order to break text one need to use the "br" tag which is an inline-element. Alternatively one can use the "p" tag which stands for paragraph and which is a block-element. 
</p>

<b>Span versus Div</b>

The important thing to remeber is:
- "span" tag elements are inline 
- "div" tags are block elements
